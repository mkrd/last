# Last CSS

The last CSS framework you will ever need!

A css library that:
- Uses a semantic syntax
- Also has utility classes that overwrite semantic components
- Small and unopinionated
- Configurable
- Community made and rated components

## Requirements
- Separation of concerns, i.e. no styling by using uitlity classes


Learned from:
- Semantic UI
- Tailwind

## Examples

    <div ui="small primary button">
